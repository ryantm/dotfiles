# ryantm's dotfiles

These are ryantm's configuration files or dotfiles (because the files often begin with a "."). It uses [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/)

If you would like to do your dotfiles in a similar way, please start with [home-manager template](https://github.com/ryantm/home-manager-template).
